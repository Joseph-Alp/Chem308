# Particle in a Box

The equation that describes quantum mechanics of a particles in well defined energy states can be determined by the time independent Schr√∂dinger Equation
  \begin{equation}\label{tise}
    \mathcal{H}\psi(x)=E\psi(x)
\end{equation}
where $$\mathcal{H}$$ is the Hamiltonian operator that is the sum of the kinetic and potential energy operators, and $$\Psi(x,t)$$ is the time independent wavefunction.
