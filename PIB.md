# Particle in a Box

The equation that describes quantum mechanics of particles in well defined energy states can be determined by the time independent Schr√∂dinger Equation
  \begin{equation}\label{tise}
    \mathcal{H}\psi(x)=E\psi(x)
\end{equation}
where $$\mathcal{H}$$ is the Hamiltonian operator that is the sum of the kinetic and potential energy operators, and $$\Psi(x)$$ is the time independent wavefunction.

Matlab can be used to plot the wavefunctions at different energy states, ([Particle in a box](1D_PIB.m)). The potential well can be modified to observe how the wavefunctions react to the change. In order for the code to work, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors need to be sorted, [here](eigsort.m).
