# Particle in a Box 

Matlab can be used to plot the wavefunctions at different energy states, ([Particle in a box](PIB5.m)). The potential well can be modified to observe how the wavefunctions react to the change. 

## Progress of Matlab Code

### Week of January 15 
[Kinetic Energy Matrix](/kinetic.m) (from 1/18)
### Week of January 22
[Particle in a Box](PIB.m) during class (from 1/23)

[Particle in a Box](PIB2.m) edits (from 1/24)

[Particle in a Box](PIB3.m) edits (from 1/25)

[Sort Eigenvalue/Eigenvectors](eigsort.m) code to value eigenvalues in asceding order (from 1/25)
### Week of January 29
[Particle in a Box](PIB4.m) edits (from 1/29)

[Particle in a Box](PIB5.m) edits that have constants equal to 1 so the wavefunctions are separated by the values of the eigenvalues (from 1/30)
