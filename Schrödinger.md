# Time Independent Schrödinger Equation (TISE)

The equation that describes quantum mechanics of particles in well defined energy states can be determined by the time independent Schrödinger Equation
  \begin{equation}\label{tise}
    \mathcal{H}\psi(x)=E\psi(x)
\end{equation}
where $$\mathcal{H}$$ is the Hamiltonian operator that is the sum of the kinetic and potential energy operators, and $$\Psi(x)$$ is the time independent wavefunction. The eigenvalues generated by the Hamilotian operator give the energy level of a specific state.

The energies of the particle in the contrained infinite region of space is quantized, and the energies and $$\Psi$$ of the particle are labeled by the principle quantum number, n. Because the time independent Schrödinger is describing a specific state, when the principle quantum number, n, is chosen for either the energy or $$\Psi$$, then it is also chosen for the other. For example, if the energy is for n=1, then $$\Psi$$ is also for n=1.

## Application: Particle in a Box (1-D)

Matlab can be used to plot the wavefunctions at different energy states, ([Particle in a box](PIB5.m)). The potential well can be modified to observe how the wavefunctions react to the change.
